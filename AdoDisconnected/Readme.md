ADO.NET is framework for interacting with any database or XML documents from any .NET application.

ADO.NET supports two types of models for interacting with the database:

### Connection

A connection sets a link between a data source and ADO.NET. Connection object establishes the physical connectivity between the application and the database with the support of connection string.

### DataAdapter

DataAdapter is a collection of command objects, which acts like a bridge between the database and the DataSet for transferring the data.
